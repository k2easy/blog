#  PostgreSQL 13 Released!

Posted on **2020-09-24** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

In PostgreSQL 13, more types of [aggregate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-aggregate.html) and [grouping set](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS) queries can leverage PostgreSQL’s efficient hash aggregation functionality, as queries with large aggregates do not have to fit entirely into memory. Queries with [partitioned tables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/ddl-partitioning.html) have received a performance boost, as there are now more cases where partitions can be pruned and where partitions can be directly joined.

 [`datetime()`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-OP-TABLE) function to its SQL/JSON path support, which converts valid time formats  to PostgreSQL-native types.

[`gen_random_uuid()`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-uuid.html), is now available without having to install any extensions.

PostgreSQL’s partitioning system is more flexible, as partitioned tables fully support logical replication and BEFORE row-level triggers.

# install

brew install postgresql
brew info postgresql

To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql   // restart
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start

To migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:
  brew postgresql-upgrade-database

This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /usr/local/var/postgres

brew services --help
brew services list 



psql -h localhost -p 5432



ls /usr/local/bin | grep 'postgre*' // postgres

$ cd /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql

psql 报错连接不上，brew services restart -vvv postgresql 显示如下

```

# view

> "a view consists of a stored query accessible as a virtual table in a  relational database or a set of documents in a document-oriented database composed  of the result set of a query or map and reduce functions."

```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_view AS

# Window functions

> unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not  cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain  their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is  able to access more than just the current row of the query result.".
>
> A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

[pg_dump](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/app-pgdump.html) is the utility for backing up your database.

- Plaintext format (readable and large) vs. binary format (unreadable and small) vs. tarball (ideal for restore)

- All of your database or specific schemas/tables

```
pg_dump database_name_here > database.sql
pg_dump -Fc database_name_here > database.bak # compressed binary format
pg_dump -Ft database_name_here > database.tar # tarball


# database already exists
pg_restore -Fc database.bak # restore compressed binary format
pg_restore -Ft database.tar # restore tarball
# database not exists
pg_restore -Fc -C database.bak # -C create 
```

excel有最大行限制，csv is text 没有最大行限制。

# COPY

-   binary
-   tab delimited
-   csv delimited

```
pgguide=# \copy (select * from users where id=1)  TO '~/employ_1.tsv';
... TO '~/employees.csv' WITH (FORMAT CSV);
... TO '~/employees.dat' WITH (FORMAT "Binary")

导入表
\copy employees FROM '~/employees.tsv';
\copy employees FROM '~/employees.csv' WITH CSV;
\copy employees FROM '~/employees.dat' WITH BINARY;
```

# Psql CLI

> Psql is the interactive terminal for working with Postgres.

-   -h the host to connect to

-   -U the user to connect with

- -p the port to connect to (default is 5432)

  psql -h localhost -U username databasename

  另一种登录方式 use a full string and let psql parse it

```
psql "dbname=dbhere host=hosthere user=userhere password=pwhere port=5432 sslmode=require"
```

# date time

## Datatypes

-   Date - Date only (2012-04-25)
-   Time - Time only (13:00:00.00)
-   Timestamp - Date and Time (2012-04-25 13:00:00.00)
-   Time with Timezone - Time only (13:00:00.00 PST)
-   Timestamp with Timezone (2012-04-25 13:00:00.00 PST)
-   Interval - A span of time (4 days)

## date_trunc

```sql
 SELECT count(*), date_trunc('day', created_at)
FROM users
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

使用2表示第二个字段，生产环境不推荐，临时(ad-hoc )使用ok

 select (now() - interval '1 month');

```sql
WHERE created_at >= (now() - interval '1 month');
//1 day , 1 days ,1 week 

select date_trunc('week',now() - interval '1 day'); -- 取出的是这周的周一日期

-- 每周注册用户数
SELECT date_trunc('week', created_at),
       count(*)
FROM users
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC; 

```

## generate_series

如果某一周没有注册用户会出现时间段折线图不连续

```sql
with weeks as (
  select week
  from generate_series('2017-01-01'::date, now()::date, '1 week'::interval) week
) -- 连续时间段

SELECT weeks.week,
       count(*)
FROM weeks,
     users
WHERE users.created_at > weeks.week
  AND users.created_at <= (weeks.week - '1 week'::interval)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC;

```

## timestamps

timestamps、timestamptz（with timezone embedded in）推荐

## extract 

```sql
 
select date_part('month', timestamp '2001-02-16 20:38:40')

```







# 磁盘占用

Apart from general OS level disk usage commands like `du -sh` or `df -H`, there might be situations where we might to track database/table/index size individually.

```
\l+ 显示所有库磁盘大小
pgguide=# select pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('dbname|tableName|index')); 

 total size of a table along with all of the indexes,
 # select pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('users'));
```

# Index

> An index is a specific structure that organizes a reference to your data that makes it easier to look up.
>
> Indexes are great for accessing your data faster. However, the trade off is that for each index you have you will insert data at a slower pace. Essentially when you insert your data with an index it must write data to two places as well as maintain the sort on the index as you insert data. 
>
> Certain indexes additionally will be more effective than others, such as indexes on numbers or timestamps (text is expensive).

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON employees(last_name, salary);
```

### Create Index Concurrently

> 当创建索引时会锁表，小表很快，大表生成索引时会造成该表一段时间无法访问。
>
>  By using CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY your index will be built without a long lock on the table while index built. 

```
create index concurrently idx_salary on employee(last_name,salary)
```

An example case is when your query returns a large percentage of the  data that exists in a table, it may not use the index. This is because  it is easiest to scan the table once, versus using the index then making additional lookups.

count(*) queries can be optimized with indexes thanks to index-only scans.* 

### [Covering Indexes](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Index-only_scans#Covering_indexes)

> Also since Postgres version 9.2, queries that touch only an index can be much faster. For this reason, it can be useful to include important  data with an index. Performance can be particularly improved if the  newly-created index has many fewer columns than the table being indexed, since many fewer pages must be retrieved from the disk in order to  satisfy the query.

# **explain**

Every query within Postgres has an execution plan when executed. There are three forms of running **explain** to expose this to you:

-   The generic form (only shows what is likely to happen)
-   Analyze form (which actually runs the query and outputs what does happen)
-   Verbose form (stay away)

```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT last_name FROM employees where salary >= 50000;
```

![image](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/k2easy/picgo/2020/11/0120201101100931.png)

In this case we see there's a high time spent and a sequential scan. As a result we may want to try to add an index and examine the results:

```
CREATE INDEX idx_emps on employees (salary);
```

# Conditional Constraints

> There are times where  you may want data constraints, but only want them to exist in certain cases.

By using a [Partial Indexes](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/indexes-partial.html) this becomes simpler by placing a unique index on only non-deleted users:

```sql
create unique index user_email on users(email) where deleted_at is null;
```

# Cache

SELECT
       sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read, 
       sum(heap_blks_hit) as heap_hit, 
       (sum(heap_blks_hit) - sum(heap_blks_read)) / sum(heap_blks_hit) as ratio

FROM
     pg_statio_user_tables;
```

If you find yourself with a ratio significantly lower than 99% then you  likely want to consider increasing the cache available to your database, ...

# HStore

 *With the release of Postgres 9.4 and JSONB,* in most cases JSONB is  a better approach than simply HStore.

HStore is a key value store within Postgres. //hstore,json,jsonb

*For a more in depth comparisson you can check out [this post](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/07/14/choosing-nosql-hstore-json-jsonb/) by [Citus Data](https://www.citusdata.com)*

> JSONB is a binary representation of JSON, this means it’s compressed  and more efficient for storage than just text. 
>
> Creating a GIN index on a JSONB column will create an index on every key and value within that JSON document.

# JSONB

适用场景：

- Event tracking data, where you may want to include the payload in the event which might vary。移动变换数据如：定位数据
- Gaming data is especially common, especially where you have single player  games and have a changing schema based on the state of the user // 游戏人物装备等级等
- Tools that integrate multiple data sources, an example here may be a tool  that integrates customers databases to Salesforce to Zendesk to  something else. The mix of schemas makes doing this in a multitenant  fashion more painful than it has to be.//混合第三方定义的数据

```sql

order by e.enumsortorder;

 create TABLE test_enum(
 id serial primary key,
 name e_contact_method
);

insert into test_enum(name) values('email'); -- '1' invalid input 
```

 Postgres does not provide a way to remove values from enums.

> Although `enum` types are primarily intended for static sets  of values, there is support for adding new values to an existing enum  type, and for renaming values (see `ALTER TYPE`). Existing values cannot be removed from an enum type.
>
> create a new type without the value, convert all existing uses of the old type to use the new type, then drop the old type.

```sql
ALTER TYPE admin_level1 ADD VALUE 'god';
DELETE FROM blah WHERE power = 'god'; -- or update

-- Convert to new type, casting via text representation
ALTER TABLE blah 
  ALTER COLUMN power TYPE admin_level1_new 
    USING (power::text::admin_level1_new);

-- and swap the types
DROP TYPE admin_level1;

ALTER TYPE admin_level1_new RENAME TO admin_level1;
```

# CTEs

Long complex SQL queries aren't always the most readable thing. 
cte ,common table expressions 

对比view

类似subquery 
Views can be indexed but CTE can't.

Views being a physical object on database (but does not store data  physically) and can be used on multiple queries, thus provide  flexibility and centralized approach. CTE, on the other hand are  temporary and will be created when they are used; that's why they are  called as `inline view`.

cte不适合大数据量的处理，   Dealing with 3.5 million rows in CTE will create extra overhead on  TempDb which will eventually slow down SQL Server performance. Remember, CTE is a disposable view hence no statistics are stored and you can't  create Indexes too. It is just like a sub query.

```

SQL 是对关键字和标识符大小写不敏感的语言，只有在标识符用双引号包围时才能保留它们的大小写。

**SQL类型**

```
int`、`smallint`、`real`、`double precision`、`char(*`N`*)`、`varchar(*`N`*)`、`date`、`time`、`timestamp`和`interval
varchar(80)
point 
```

PostgreSQL中可以定制任意数量的用户定义数据类型。因而类型名并不是语法关键字 

```
create table weather(
	city varchar(80) ,
	temp_lo int,
	temp_hi int,
	prcp real ,-- 湿度 
	date date,-- '2020-10-20'  date类型实际上对可接收的格式相当灵活,推荐如此
)     
drop table tablename;

CREATE TABLE cities (
    name            varchar(80),
    location        point  -- '(-194.0,53.0)'
);
```

`COPY`从文本文件中装载大量数据。这种方式通常更快，因为`COPY`命令就是为这类应用优化的， 只是比 `INSERT`少一些灵活性

```
COPY weather FROM '/home/user/weather.txt';
```

这里源文件的文件名必须在运行后端进程的机器上是可用的， 而不是在客户端上，因为后端进程将直接读取该文件。 

人们广泛认为在一个连接查询中限定所有列名是一种好的风格，这样即使未来向其中一个表里添加重名列也不会导致查询失败。   select t.name,b.name

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM weather, cities
    WHERE city = name;
等同于
SELECT *
    FROM weather INNER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);
```

扫描`weather`表， 并且对每一行都找出匹配的`cities`表行。如果我们没有找到匹配的行，那么我们需要一些“空值”代替cities表的列。 这种类型的查询叫*外连接* 

```sql
SELECT *
    FROM weather LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON (weather.city = cities.name);
```

也可以把一个表和自己连接起来。这叫做*自连接*。  

### 聚集函数

聚集`max`不能被用于`WHERE`子句中（存在这个限制是因为`WHERE`子句决定哪些行可以被聚集计算包括；因此显然它必需在聚集函数之前被计算
每个聚集结果都是在匹配该城市的表行上面计算的。我们可以用`HAVING` 过滤这些被分组的行

```sql
SELECT city, max(temp_lo)
    FROM weather
    GROUP BY city
    HAVING max(temp_lo) < 40;
```

`WHERE`在分组和聚集计算之前选取输入行（因此，它控制哪些行进入聚集计算）， 而`HAVING`在分组和聚集之后选取分组行。

因此，`WHERE`子句不能包含聚集函数；  HAVING`子句总是包含聚集函数（严格说来，你可以写不使用聚集的`HAVING`子句， 但这样做很少有用。同样的条件用在`WHERE`阶段会更有效）。   

```
DELETE FROM tablename; 将从指定表中删除所有行，把它清空。做这些之前系统不会请求你确认！ 
```

### 视图

```
CREATE VIEW myview AS
    SELECT
```

​    对视图的使用是成就一个好的SQL数据库设计的关键方面。视图允许用户通过始终如一的接口封装表的结构细节，这样可以避免表结构随着应用的进化而改变。   

​    视图几乎可以用在任何可以使用表的地方。在其他视图基础上创建视图也并不少见。   

### 外建

我们希望确保在`cities`表中有相应项之前任何人都不能在`weather`表中插入行。这叫做维持数据的*引用完整性*。正确使用外键无疑会提高数据库应用的质量，

```
CREATE TABLE weather (
        city      varchar(80) references cities(city),
```

### 事务

事务最重要的一点是它将多个步骤捆绑成了一个单一的、要么全完成要么全不完成的操作。步骤之间的中间状态对于其他并发事务是不可见的，并且如果有某些错误发生导致事务不能完成，则其中任何一个步骤都不会对数据库造成影响。   

原子更新：当多个事务并发运行时，每一个都不能看到其他事务未完成的修改。例如，如果一个事务正忙着总计所有支行的余额，它不会只包括Alice的支行的扣款而不包括Bob的支行的存款，或者反之。所以事务的全做或全不做并不只体现在它们对数据库的持久影响，也体现在它们发生时的可见性。**一个事务所做的更新在它完成之前对于其他事务是不可见的，而之后所有的更新将同时变得可见。**   

开启一个事务需要将SQL命令用`BEGIN`和`COMMIT`命令包围起来。

```
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Alice';
-- etc etc
COMMIT; -- ROLLBACK
```

PostgreSQL实际上将每一个SQL语句都作为一个事务来执行。如果我们没有发出`BEGIN`命令，则每个独立的语句都会被加上一个隐式的`BEGIN`以及（如果成功）`COMMIT`来包围它。一组被`BEGIN`和`COMMIT`包围的语句也被称为一个*事务块*。   

某些客户端库会自动发出`BEGIN`和`COMMIT`命令，因此我们可能会在不被告知的情况下得到事务块的效果。

**保存点**

​    可以利用*保存点*来以更细的粒度来控制一个事务中的语句。保存点允许我们有选择性地放弃事务的一部分而提交剩下的部分。在使用`SAVEPOINT`定义一个保存点后，我们可以在必要时利用`ROLLBACK TO`回滚到该保存点。该事务中位于保存点和回滚点之间的数据库修改都会被放弃，但是早于该保存点的修改则会被保存。   

不管是释放保存点还是回滚到保存点都会释放定义在该保存点之后的所有其他保存点。   

当提交整个事务块时，被提交的动作将作为一个单元变得对其他会话可见，而被回滚的动作则永远不会变得可见。   

`ROLLBACK TO`是唯一的途径来重新控制一个由于错误被系统置为中断状态的事务块，

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Alice';
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Bob';
-- oops ... forget that and use Wally's account
ROLLBACK TO my_savepoint;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = 'Wally';
COMMIT;
```

### 窗口函数

​    一个*窗口函数*在一系列与当前行有某种关联的表行上执行一种计算。这与一个聚集函数所完成的计算有可比之处。**但是窗口函数并不会使多行被聚集成一个单独的输出行，**这与通常的非窗口聚集函数不同。取而代之，行保留它们独立的标识。在这些现象背后，窗**口函数可以访问的不仅仅是查询结果的当前行。**   

```sql
SELECT depname, empno, salary, avg(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname) FROM empsalary;
```

第四列表示对与当前行具有**相同**`depname`值的所有表行取得平均值（这实际和非窗口`avg`聚集函数是相同的函数，但是`OVER`子句使得它被当做一个窗口函数处理并在一个合适的窗口帧上计算。）。   

可以通过`OVER`上的`ORDER BY`控制窗口函数处理行的顺序（窗口的`ORDER BY`并不一定要符合行输出的顺序

```sql
SELECT depname, empno, salary,
       rank() OVER (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC) FROM empsalary;
```

```
  depname  | empno | salary | rank
-----------+-------+--------+------
 develop   |     8 |   6000 |    1
 develop   |    10 |   5200 |    2
 develop   |    11 |   5200 |    2
 develop   |     9 |   4500 |    4
 develop   |     7 |   4200 |    5
 personnel |     2 |   3900 |    1
 personnel |     5 |   3500 |    2
 sales     |     1 |   5000 |    1
 sales     |     4 |   4800 |    2
 sales     |     3 |   4800 |    2
(10 rows)
```

一个窗口函数调用总是包含一个直接跟在窗口函数名及其参数之后的`OVER`子句。这使得它从句法上和一个普通函数或非窗口函数区分开来。`OVER`子句决定究竟查询中的哪些行被分离出来由窗口函数处理。`OVER`子句中的`PARTITION BY`子句指定了将具有相同`PARTITION BY`表达式值的行分到组或者分区。对于每一行，窗口函数都会在当前行同一分区的行上进行计算。   

一个窗口函数所考虑的行属于那些通过查询的`FROM`子句产生并通过`WHERE`、`GROUP BY`、`HAVING`过滤的“虚拟表”。
在一个查询中可以包含多个窗口函数，每个窗口函数都可以用不同的`OVER`子句来按不同方式划分数据，但是它们都作用在由虚拟表定义的同一个行集上。   

如果行的顺序不重要时`ORDER BY`可以忽略。`PARTITION BY`同样也可以被忽略，在这种情况下会产生一个包含所有行的分区。   

```
SELECT salary, sum(salary) OVER () FROM empsalary;

 salary |  sum
--------+-------
   5200 | 47100
   5000 | 47100
   3500 | 47100
   4800 | 47100
   3900 | 47100
   4200 | 47100
```

**`OVER`子句中没有`ORDER BY`，窗口帧和分区一**样
**缺少`PARTITION BY`则和整个表一样**

对于每一行，在它的分区中的行集被称为它的窗口帧。 一些窗口函数只作用在*窗口帧*中的行上，而不是整个分区。// 在分区中的当前范围内的行集合就是窗口帧

默认情况下，如果使用`ORDER BY`，则帧包括**从分区开始到当前行的所有行**，**以及后续任何与当前行在`ORDER BY`子句上相等的行**。如果`ORDER BY`被忽略，则默认帧包含整个分区中所有的行。

```
SELECT salary, sum(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) FROM empsalary;
 salary |  sum
--------+-------
   3500 |  3500
   3900 |  7400
   4200 | 11600
   4500 | 16100
   4800 | 25700
   4800 | 25700
   5000 | 30700  
   5200 | 41100 //order by salary,salary相同则当前行延伸，则属于同一个窗口帧
   5200 | 41100
   6000 | 47100
(10 rows)
这里的合计是从第一个（最低的）薪水一直到当前行，包括任何与当前行相同的行（注意相同薪水行的结果）。 
```

窗口函数只允许出现在查询的`SELECT`列表和`ORDER BY`子句中。它们不允许出现在其他地方，例如`GROUP BY`、`HAVING`和`WHERE`子句中。**这是因为窗口函数的执行逻辑是在处理完这些子句之后。**另外，**窗口函数在非窗口聚集函数之后执行。**这意味着可以在窗口函数的参数中包括一个聚集函数，但反过来不行。   

如果需要在窗口计算执行后进行过滤或者分组，我们可以使用子查询

```sql
SELECT  *
FROM
  (SELECT  rank() OVER (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC, empno) AS pos
     FROM empsalary
  ) AS ss
WHERE pos < 3;
```

如果多个窗口函数要求同一个窗口行为时，这种做法是冗余的而且容易出错的。替代方案是，每一个窗口行为可以被放在一个命名的`WINDOW`子句中，然后在`OVER`中引用它。

```sql
SELECT sum(salary) OVER w, avg(salary) OVER w
  FROM empsalary
  WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC);		
```

### 继承

继承是面向对象数据库中的概念。它展示了数据库设计的新的可能性。   
尽管继承很有用，但是它还未与唯一约束或外键集成，这也限制了它的可用性。

```
CREATE TABLE cities (
  name       text,
  population real,
  altitude   int     -- (in ft)
);

CREATE TABLE capitals (
  state      char(2)
) INHERITS (cities);

SELECT name, altitude
    FROM ONLY cities
    WHERE altitude > 500;
```

`ONLY`用于指示查询只在`cities`表上进行而不会涉及到继承层次中位于`cities`之下的其他表。很多我们已经讨论过的命令 — `SELECT`、`UPDATE` 和`DELETE` — 都支持这个`ONLY`记号。   



# fedora

Red Hat 所有的软件产品全部是开源（Open Sourced) 的。注意是“所有”，无一例外！红帽所有的企业级产品，一定对应一个社区版产品.

如**RHEL的社区版就是Fedora** 
Redhat是把Fedora作为RHEL的试验田，就是说在Fedora上会尽量使用一些最新的内核特性和用户层工具，等试验的差不多了，RHEL某个系列的Alpha版就直接Base在Fedora之上。
CentOS只是社区对RHEL的编译版本，跟RHEL应该差别不大。

我眼中的各linux发行版Fedora: 小白鼠，Red Hat 經常會往上強推一些不考慮兼容性的大變更。
Arch: 高效，輕量，面向專業用戶，有一定危險性。
Ubuntu: 面向初級用戶，比較傻瓜，靠能幹的妹妹（Debian）照料。
Red Hat: 企業級別技術支持。爲了穩定性所以經常比較老舊。
CentOS: 本質上和 Red Hat 的內容是一致的，但是沒有技術支持。兼顧 Red Hat 劣勢（老舊）和別的快速發行版的劣勢（沒有技術支持）。
Gentoo: 完全自己定製自己編譯，對自己全權負責，面向「真正」專業的用戶，能做到很多別的發行版做不到的事情，同時耗費時間（編譯）和金錢（電能）。
openSuSE: 美觀漂亮，有個強大的系統配置工具（yast）無微不至地照顧你，面向初級用戶。
slackware: 堅持老舊的觀念（用戶應該自己管理包依賴）和古典美學。
Debian: 能幹而靠譜，是 Ubuntu 的妹妹但是比 Ubuntu 靠譜很多。
Mint：就是Ubuntu帶個面具
